About
################

The Game of Thrones Companion Web App is intended to be a sort of interactive guide to the ins and outs of the fictional realm, helping both newcomers keep up with the many characters and concepts being introduced, and helping veteran watchers remember things that they may have forgotten over the seasons. This is accomplished with an interactive map of the known world, a personalized, spoiler-free encyclopedia of characters, locations, houses, and guilds. This ensures the viewer doesn't get lost physically or narratively, without the risk of spoilers or being overwhelmed by the volume of information present about the series.
