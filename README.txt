Game of Thrones Companion Kit

I was inspired to make this project mainly at Aphid's suggestion, but I took it in a slightly different direction. Rather than it being driven by data collection, I turned it into a sort of guide for newcomers (or even veterans) of the show. I have read the books, and many of the subtleties are lost on pure show-watchers that I feel that my guide will clear up.

I plan on iterating and expanding this idea to be a complete guide with a full, personalized companion encyclopedia at the watcher's fingertips.

Obviously, this project incorporates Game of Thrones, created by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, and references the source material book series, A Song of Ice and Fire, by George R.R. Martin.

I would have liked to include (and will in the future) much more content, including factions and locations, and more temporalized data. Feature-wise, I would have liked to do an overlay of character markers on the map, to track their locations through the show, and I would have liked to allow for more fullscreen functionality. Most importantly, I would like to include a version for people without a copy of the episode on their computer, or at least for people with file types other than mp4.
