			<h1 id="name">How to use the Game of Thrones Companion App</h1>
			<div id="facts">
				<p>
					The Game of Thrones Companion Web App is intended to be a sort of interactive guide to the ins and outs of the fictional realm, helping both newcomers keep up with the many characters and concepts being introduced, and helping veteran watchers remember things that they may have forgotten over the seasons. This is accomplished with an interactive map of the known world, a personalized, spoiler-free encyclopedia of characters, locations, houses, and guilds. This ensures the viewer doesn't get lost physically or narratively, without the risk of spoilers or being overwhelmed by the volume of information present about the series.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first thing you should do is upload a video of the episode you're going to watch, if you have one. If not, you'll have to manually keep the default video (just a picture) synced up to the video you're watching. If you do not, the information will either be behind or ahead of where you are.
				</p>
				<p>***IMPORTANT NOTE: Clicking on links pauses the video in the app. This means you should pause your video as well, if it's not playing in the app. Trust me, if you didn't, you'd only get more lost.***</p>
				<p>
					After uploading the video, choose the season and episode you'll be watching (as this is being written, there is only support for S01E01). Click "Go".
				</p>
				<p>
					As the episode plays, a bar on the bottom will contain boxes referring to some element of the show. If you hover over these boxes, a quick list of facts will show up to remind you of who they are. If this doesn't work, clicking on them opens their corresponding encyclopedia page in a new window. If the bar gets longer than the screen, click and drag it to move the truncated boxes into view.
