					The first thing you should do is upload a video of the episode you're going to watch, if you have one. If not, you'll have to manually keep the default video (just a picture) synced up to the video you're watching. If you don't do this, the information will either be behind or ahead of where you are.
				</p>
				<p>***IMPORTANT NOTE: Clicking on links pauses the video in the app. This means you should pause your video as well, if it's not playing in the app. Trust me, if you didn't, you'd only get more lost.***</p>
				<p>
					After uploading the video, choose the season and episode you'll be watching (as this is being written, there is only support for S01E01). Click "Go".
				</p>
				<p>
					As the episode plays, a bar on the bottom will contain boxes referring to some element of the show. If you hover over these boxes, a quick list of facts will show up to remind you of who they are. If you want more details, click on them to open their corresponding encyclopedia page in a new window. If the bar extends off your screen, click and drag it to move the truncated boxes into view.
